## MWS Stage 2

### How to test

Before testing project, we need to run server to consume api. .

```
cd server 
```

```
npm install
```
```
npm start
```

npm start will start api server and now we can go back to main directory.
 
```
cd ..
```

```
npm install
```

```
npm run build
```

Now you can use any server to run to test app.
